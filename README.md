# Self Care

## Description

A small project designed to make sure you're staying hydrated and avoiding eye strain and myopia from screens. I love looking at screens, I love trolling forums, discord channels, watching movies, youtube content, playing games, etc, but it's honestly too much. I've had terrible vision I've had surgically corrected, and I'm not going to screw it up again.

> Straining vision introduces a host of eye-related health problems. And it’s more than just kids needing prescriptions. “People say ‘oh, it’s just glasses,’” says Dr Aaron Miller, a pediatric ophthalmologist at Houston Eye Associates. “The nearsighted have much higher chances of retina tears and glaucoma, bigger issues secondary to nearsightedness. It’s the long game we worry about.”

[_Why staring at screens is making your eyeballs elongate – and how to stop it (The Guardian)_](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/nov/14/eyeballs-screens-vision-nearsightedness-myopia)

For now, this is going to be a PWA with two functions:

- To remind you to look away from the screen at something 20 feet away at most every 20 mins for at least 20 seconds (20/20/20 rule).
- To remind you to drink water.

The idea is to notify you of both; I see the benefit of having them as separate notifications/pagers, but then you're going to get slapped with a notification twice.
